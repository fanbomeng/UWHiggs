This folder contains the files used in the limit extracting, also the plotters used to plot the limit plots.
combineplothighmasstuning.py is used for the 200~300GeV mass range tunning plots
combineplothighmasstuning450.py is used for the 450~900GeV mass range tunning plots
The reality is the difference is small.

combineplot_limit.py is used for normal limit plotting, not in the tuning
combineplot_limit_all3.py is used for plotting all of the limits for 0-jet, 1-jet and combined together in the same plot

producecard_highmass.py is used for tuning data card producing.

producecombinehigh.py is used for tuning running the combine command

The combine harvester configuration file is in the folder  combineHarvester_configurationfile  as you can see, the difference is very small,
just direct them to get the correct signal
